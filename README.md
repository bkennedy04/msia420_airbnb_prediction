# Airbnb New User Bookings
Where will a new guest book their first travel experience? You can find the link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings).

## Business problem
The goal is to help Airbnb predict which country a new user will make his or her first booking.
By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand.

This type of classification problem is applicable for many internet/service companies that are looking to drive new users to their website and improve personalization of content to users.

## Data Structure

* **Users** - demographic information about the user along with information about when and how the individual first signed up to be an Airbnb member.
